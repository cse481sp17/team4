To run with the interactive markers:

Step 1: roscore

Step 2: open gazebo

Step 3: open rviz

Step 4: Make sure the "Fixed Frame" for rviz is "odom"

To move with keyboard and have a line of where the robot went:

rosrun applications keyboard_teleop_viz.py

To have interative markers

rosrun applications interactive_marker_demo.py

*  Both files can be run at the same time

Files to modify:

Driver.py  (handles the rotation and movement)

interactive_marker_demo.py (handles the 3 interactive markers)

Currently: The markers work, but robot rotation does not work properly.
           Also, the is no code to handle overshooting the target
