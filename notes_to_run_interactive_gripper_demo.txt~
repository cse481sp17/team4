Instructions for running the interactive gripper demo (both moving the individual gripper, and creating a three-step automatic picking procedure

[Terminal 1]
roscore

[Terminal 2]
roslaunch fetch_gazebo playground.launch 

[Terminal 3]
rosrun rviz rviz

[Terminal 4]
roslaunch fetch_api move_group.launch

[Terminal 5]
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/cse481c/applications/scripts
python interactive_gripper_demo.py

At this point, the markers should be visible and movable in Rviz. There should be updates in the last terminal everytime they are moved or rotated.

Note that we are managing the switch between the single-gripper mode and the picking-procedure mode by commenting out either "teleop = GripperTeleop(arm, gripper, im_server)" or "auto_pick = AutoPickTeleop(arm, gripper, im_server)" in the "main" method in python interactive_gripper_demo.py.

To actually position the robot near the table to pick up the object, run "rosrun applications keyboard_teleop.py" and drive around in another terminal.

Also, it might be helpful to list up the torso:
rosrun applications torso_demo.py 0.3

Or move the head up and down:
rosrun applications head_demo.py pan_tilt 0 0.5
